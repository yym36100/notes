Tensilica's Smallest 32-bit RISC Controller Core

The Diamond Standard 106Micro CPU is a cache-less 32-bit controller ideal for designers looking for a basic 32-bit controller, particularly for those migrating up from an 8- or 16-bit controller.  Designed for applications with requirements for minimal size and low power, the Diamond Standard 106Micro controller enables SOC architects to quickly integrate this efficient CPU in their designs.

Although the Diamond 106Micro is extremely small, it employs a 5-stage pipeline so it can achieve 650 MHz in 65gp process and up to 900 MHz in 45gs process technology. By modelessly switching between 24- and 16-bit narrow instructions, it achieves much higher code density than other 32/16-bit architectures.

The local, tightly-coupled instruction and data memory on the Diamond Standard 106Micro can be used to store performance-sensitive code and data, for example, to achieve high performance on interrupt handlers. The Diamond 106Micro has an iterative, multi-cycle (non-pipelined) 32x32 multiplier that enhances performance on arithmetic and DSP code. The processor uses a non-windowed 16-entry register file to keep area low.

The Diamond Standard 106Micro has a rich interrupt architecture with the integrated interrupt controller providing 15 interrupts, and an integrated timer. This simplifies system design since no external hardware needs to be added for these functions.
